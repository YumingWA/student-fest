## 💌 From the Maintainers

Hey student! 👋

We created this project because we remember how intimidating open source felt when we were starting out. This is the project we wish existed when we were learning.

Don't worry about being perfect. Don't worry about asking "basic" questions. Everyone here is learning, and we're all supporting each other.

Your contribution, no matter how small, makes this community better. We're excited to see what you'll build!

Happy coding! 🚀
