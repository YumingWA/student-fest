# ðŸ‘¥ Live Contributors Page (Planned)

This page will display all contributors who have completed the beginner tasks and had their pull requests merged!

## How It Will Work
- When a contributor completes the beginner tasks and their PR is merged, their info (name, avatar, fun fact, emoji) will be added to a JSON file (e.g., `contributors.json`).
- This page will read from that file and display a live, interactive gallery of contributors.
- The update will be automated using a GitHub Action.

## Features (Planned)
- Contributor avatars and names
- Fun facts and favorite emojis
- Filter/search by name or country
- Encouragement to star the repo

## Coming Soon!
