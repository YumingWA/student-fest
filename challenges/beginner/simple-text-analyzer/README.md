## 📝 Challenge Description

Create a command-line tool that analyzes a piece of text provided by the user. The tool should provide basic statistics about the text.

## 🎯 Requirements

Your program must:

1.  **Prompt the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.**
2.  **Calculate and display the following:**
    *   Total word count.
    *   Total character count (including spaces).
    *   The most frequent word and its count.
    *   A list of all unique words.
3.  **Handle edge cases gracefully**, such as empty input.

## 📊 Example Output

```
Enter a sentence or paragraph to analyze:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog is happy.

--- Text Analysis Results ---
Word Count: 12
Character Count: 55
Most Frequent Word: "The" (appears 2 times)
Unique Words: ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog.', 'dog', 'is', 'happy.']

Thank you for using the Simple Text Analyzer!

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

*   You are free to implement this in **any programming language** you are comfortable with.
*   Focus on clean, readable code with comments where necessary.
*   Consider how to handle punctuation. For a beginner-level challenge, you can either include it as part of the word or strip it out.

## 🧪 How to Test Your Solution

1.  Run your script from the command line.
2.  Enter different sentences to see if the output is correct.
3.  Test with a single word, a long paragraph, and empty input.
4.  Add your solution file to the `solutions/` directory in a sub-folder named after your GitHub username (e.g., `solutions/sehmaluva/`).

Happy coding! 🚀
