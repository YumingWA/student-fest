# üéÆ Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate  
**Topics**: Game Logic, 2D Arrays, User Input, UI (Web or Console)

## üìù Project Description

Create a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game. This classic project is a fantastic way to practice fundamental programming concepts like game loops, state management, and win-condition checking.

## üéØ Core Features

1.  **Game Board**: A 3x3 grid that can be displayed either in the command line or in a web browser.
2.  **Two Players**: The game should alternate turns between two players (e.g., 'X' and 'O').
3.  **Input Handling**: Players should be able to choose a cell to place their mark.
4.  **Win Condition**: The game must detect when a player has won (three in a row, column, or diagonal).
5.  **Draw Condition**: The game must detect when the board is full and no one has won.
6.  **Game Over State**: Once the game is over (win or draw), it should display the result and stop accepting moves.

## ‚ú® Bonus Features (Optional)

*   **Player vs. AI**: Implement a simple AI opponent that can play against a human player.
*   **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the score between the two players over multiple games.
*   **GUI**: Build a graphical user interface using a library like Pygame (Python), Swing (Java), or HTML/CSS/JS for a web version.
*   **Multiplayer**: Allow two players to play over a local network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Suggestions

*   **Web**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a browser-based game.
*   **Python**: A great choice for a console version, or with Pygame for a GUI.
*   **Java**: Can be built as a console application or with a GUI using Swing or JavaFX.
*   **C++**: For a high-performance console or GUI version.

## üß™ How to Contribute

2.  Build your game.
3.  Include a `README.md` in your solution directory explaining how to run your game.
4.  Submit a pull request with your completed game.

Have fun building this classic game! üöÄ
